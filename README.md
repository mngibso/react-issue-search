# React Issue Search

This project was created using Barebones React/Sass/Express/TypeScript Boilerplate.

https://github.com/covalence-io/barebones-react-typescript-express

## task

Using Github’s API (https://developer.github.com/), build an application with an autocomplete input box for searching issues for React’s repo (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues). Input and results should be able to navigate via keyboard shortcuts. Each result should have but not limited to, the issue’s title and labels.

## description

To illustrate skills on the frontend and the back-end, this typescript node.js and react project presents a search box to the user.

As the user begins to enter terms to search, the github api is called to retrieve results. The results are displayed along with an autocomplete option.

The user has the option to press `enter` to select the first option, or select an issue from the search results.
